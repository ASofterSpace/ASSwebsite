<h3>What We Do</h3>
<div class="content">
Our goal in creating A Softer Space is to enable exciting and wonderful science to happen - especially in the space sector (Mars, we are coming!), but in any other field as well.<br>
To do that, we intend to write the best software we can - as we are all software-people (sorry, we cannot help you with building any interesting hardware just yet!)
</div>
<div class="content">
After gathering experience in “the real world,” we noticed that grand scientific endeavours currently are facing many silly problems.
<ul>
<li>
Many companies right now overpromise, then cannot deliver on time, and many big projects are suffering for it
</li>
<li>
Contracts are interpreted in the narrowest possible sense, such that companies get away with working as little as possible, meaning that contracts nowadays need to be more and more detailed, and a whole bunch of everyone's time is wasted just explicitly writing out what should be clear in the first place - or what could be determined through some informal communication in a couple of minutes
</li>
<li>
Scientists at universities struggle as students produce wonderful programs that can do amazing things - but then leave, and never manage to fully complete their projects, or to maintain them to ensure they are still working a year down the road
</li>
</ul>
Our answer is A <b>Softer</b> Space - we are upfront, do not overpromise, and are flexible in adapting even when your needs change, or when your ideas become clearer and more refined throughout the project.
