		As mentioned on our <a href="mission.php">mission page</a>, we actually believe in open access... a lot.<br>
		We therefore proudly present a (very!) small archive of textures we created for our 3D and VR applications here - and who knows, maybe also other resources in the future.

	<div class="content">
		All of these textures have been created by A Softer Space and are made freely made available to you to use however you please.<br>
		If you need a more exact license, just <a href="mailto:info@asofterspace.com">contact us</a>, and I am sure we can figure something out. :)
